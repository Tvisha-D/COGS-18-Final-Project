COGS 18 Final Project: Mood-Based Music Recommender (K-Pop ver.)

This recommender takes in user mood and basic music choice and presents a recommendation that matches the specified preferences. Then, if the user is interested, it also provides a recommendation to a general K-Pop playlist either on Spotify or YouTube, again on the basis of user preference.

This is my first Python project :)
